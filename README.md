# Rikai OCR
## WARNING
This is a demo model type for Rikai to do OCR.

It is not for production usage. As far as I know, there is a severe keras-ocr (0.8.90) memory leak issue.

## Developers' Guide
First of all, please create the virtual python env for developing.

The following command will install the deps and this repo.
```
pip install --use-feature=in-tree-build .\[dev\]
```

Finally, under the created virtual env, launch jupyter-lab and try notebooks.
